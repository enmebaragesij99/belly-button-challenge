# Belly-button-challenge

This is my Module 14- Belly Button Biodiversity challenge, which consists of one HTML file, one JavaScriptfile and a JSON file. All the files work together in unison to build an
interative dashboard to explore telly Button Biodiversity dataset.

## Contents

- index(HTML file)

- samples(JSON file)

- app(JavaScript file)

- https://enmebaragesij99.github.io/belly-button-challenge/ (app which can be deployed via GitHub Pages)

## About

-A dropdown menu was created with an option for each sample name(ID No. with a total of 153 samples)

-A horizontal bar chart was created to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual sample (selelcted in the dropdown menu)

-A bubble chart was created that displays every sample (of the selected sample in the dropdown menu) consisting of: marker size(sample_values),marker colors(otu_ids) and text values(otu_labels)

-A demographics object which displays each key-value pair from the metadata (of the selected sample in the dropdown menu)

-An app which can be deployed via the above link in the Contents section via GitHub Pages




Note; I did receive guidance from a couple of LAs in figuring out how to build my intial functions(dropdown Menu and some chart formatting) and assistance from a tutor in deploying
my app via GitHub Pages
